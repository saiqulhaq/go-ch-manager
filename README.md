```
8. Open `http://localhost:7011` in your browser


### Unit test
*tips: if you use `VS Code` as your code editor, you can install extension `golang.go` and follow tutorial [showing code coverage after saving your code](https://dev.to/vuong/golang-in-vscode-show-code-coverage-of-after-saving-test-8g0) to help you create unit test*

- Use [Mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) to generate mock class(es)
```sh
make mock d=DependencyClassName
```
- Run unit test with command below or You can run test per function using Vscode!
```sh
make test
```


### Running In Docker
- Docker Build for APP
```sh
docker build -t go-ch-manager-app:1.0.1 -f ./deploy/docker/app/Dockerfile .
```
- Run docker compose for API and Workers
```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
```


## Desktop App

The desktop app provides a native experience for macOS, Windows, and Linux using [Wails](https://wails.io/).

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24+
- Wails CLI v2
- Platform-specific requirements:
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
  - **Windows**: WebView2 (usually pre-installed on Windows 10/11)
  - **Linux**: `gtk3`, `webkit2gtk` (see [Wails Linux Guide](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation#linux))

### Install Wails CLI
```sh
go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest
wails doctor  # Verify installation
```

### Development Mode
Run the desktop app with hot-reload:
```sh
make desktop-dev
```

### Building for Distribution

**Build for current platform:**
```sh
make desktop-build
```

**Build for specific platforms:**
```sh
# macOS (Universal binary - Intel & Apple Silicon)
make desktop-build-darwin

# Windows
make desktop-build-windows

# Linux
make desktop-build-linux
```

The built application will be located in `cmd/desktop/build/bin/`.

### Distributing to Others

1. Build the app for the target platform
2. Compress the output:
   ```sh
   # macOS
   cd cmd/desktop/build/bin
   zip -r "Go-CH-Manager-macOS.zip" "Go CH Manager.app"

   # Windows - share the .exe file directly
   # Linux - share the binary directly
   ```
3. Share via file sharing service (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)

**Note for macOS users:** Since the app is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate, recipients need to:
1. Right-click the app and select "Open"
2. Click "Open" in the security dialog
3. Or go to System Settings > Privacy & Security and click "Open Anyway"

### Automated Builds (GitHub Actions)

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds the desktop app for all platforms.

**Trigger a release build:**
```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will:
1. Build for macOS (Universal), Windows (amd64), and Linux (amd64)
2. Create a GitHub Release with all binaries attached

**Manual trigger:** You can also trigger builds manually from the Actions tab using "workflow_dispatch".
