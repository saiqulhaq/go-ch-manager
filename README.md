`go-ch-manager` is a powerful, lightweight, and efficient management tool designed to simplify day-to-day operations of ClickHouse databases at scale.
It provides engineers, data teams, and platform owners with deep visibility into query execution, system performance, storage usage, and cluster health—all from a centralized and easy-to-use interface.

Built with performance and operability in mind, go-ch-manager helps teams move from reactive firefighting to proactive optimization by turning raw ClickHouse system data into actionable insights.

Goals
- Simplify ClickHouse administration by providing clear visibility and centralized control
- Quickly identify performance bottlenecks in queries, storage, and resource usage
- Enable faster troubleshooting and optimization with actionable insights and metrics
- Improve Operational Confidence & Stability

## Tech Stacks

- Mockery (Optional) (See [Mockery Installation](https://github.com/vektra/mockery))
- Redis (Optional based on your requirement) (See [Redis Installation](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) or use in Docker)

#### Windows OS (for a better development experience)

*   Install [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (See [Make Installation](https://leangaurav.medium.com/how-to-setup-install-gnu-make-on-windows-324480f1da69)).


### Installation
1. Clone this repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rahmatrdn/go-ch-manager.git
```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
3. Adjust the `.env` file according to the configuration in your local environment, such as the database, ClickHouse settings, and other configurations
4. Install dependencies
```sh
go mod download
```
5. Start the Application Service
```sh
go run cmd/app/main.go
```
8. Open `http://localhost:7012` in your browser


### Unit test
*tips: if you use `VS Code` as your code editor, you can install extension `golang.go` and follow tutorial [showing code coverage after saving your code](https://dev.to/vuong/golang-in-vscode-show-code-coverage-of-after-saving-test-8g0) to help you create unit test*

- Use [Mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) to generate mock class(es)
```sh
make mock d=DependencyClassName
```
- Run unit test with command below or You can run test per function using Vscode!
```sh
make test
```


### Running In Docker
- Docker Build for APP
```sh
docker build -t go-ch-manager-app:1.0.1 -f ./deploy/docker/app/Dockerfile .
```
- Run docker compose for API and Workers
```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
```


## Fiber Web App Bundles

The project now distributes a Fiber web UI bundle for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
Each bundle contains:
- server binary (`Go CH Manager Server` / `Go CH Manager Server.exe`)
- view templates (`internal/views`)
- launcher script (`Start Go CH Manager.bat` or `start-go-ch-manager.sh`)

### Local Development

Run the web app directly:
```sh
go run ./cmd/app
```

Open:
```text
http://127.0.0.1:8760/
```

### Automated Builds (GitHub Actions)

The repository includes a workflow that builds Fiber bundles for all target OS.

**Trigger a release build:**
```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will:
1. Build bundle artifacts for macOS, Windows, and Linux
2. Create a GitHub Release with all bundle files attached

**Manual trigger:** You can also trigger builds manually from the Actions tab using `workflow_dispatch`.
